# oLbot

A simple WIP Telegram chat bot, based on the PHP [Slim Microframework](https://www.slimframework.com/).

#### What's it supposed to do?

- respond to personal or group messages with text and picture messages (for now)
- choose an answer category based on simple keywords (and custom Category rules) and answer accordingly (while filling placeholders)
- receive custom commands
- parse and evaluate simple math expressions via [PHPythagoras](https://github.com/0lsen/phpythagoras)
- get weather data for a location via [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- translate stuff via [Yandex Translate API](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/)
- (WIP) implement some weird _'karma'_ system for users, depending on how friendly they interact with the bot, and answering accordingly (un)friendly
- (WIP) cron jobs to send stuff like error reports
