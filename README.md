# oLbot v3

Third time's the charm?

(v2 didn't even make it to repo - tried to mimic a terribad handmade framework)

### What will be different?

- a Readme File!
- English, code monkey! Do you write it?!
- There will be a Framework! (Slim)
- There will be Unit Tests and stuff!
- There will be a DB schema!
- There will be Exception Handling! (to a limited extend, let's be honest)
